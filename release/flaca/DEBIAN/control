Description: Brute-force Lossless Compression for JPEG and PNG
 Flaca is a CLI frontend written in Rust to aid the complex task of
 squeezing every last drop of space out of JPEG and PNG images â€”
 without sacrificing quality.
 .
 Flaca uses MozJPEG and Jpegoptim for lossless JPEG re-compression and PNGOUT,
 Oxipng, and Zopflipng for lossless PNG compression.
 .
 The image compression binaries are not bundled with this package and must be
 installed separately.

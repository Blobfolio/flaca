.SH NAME
Flaca \- Manual page for flaca v2.2.2.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Brute\-force, lossless JPEG and PNG compression.
.SS USAGE:
.TP
flaca [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <PATH(s)…>
.SS FLAGS:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-jpeg\fR
Skip JPEG images.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-png\fR
Skip PNG images.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-progress\fR
Show progress bar while minifying.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.
.SS OPTIONS:
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR <FILE>
Read (absolute) image and/or directory paths from this text file, one entry per line.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR <NUM>
Run NUM lz77 backward/forward iterations during zopfli PNG encoding passes. More iterations yield better compression (up to a point), but require *significantly* longer processing times. In practice, values beyond 500 are unlikely to save more than a few bytes, and could take *days* to complete! Haha. [default: 20 or 60, depending on the file size]
.SS <PATH(S)…>:
.TP
One or more image and/or directory paths to losslessly compress.
.SH EARLY EXIT
Press CTRL+C once to quit as soon as the already\-in\-progress operations have
.RE
finished (ignoring any pending images still in the queue).
.RE

.RE
Press CTRL+C a second time if you need to exit IMMEDIATELY, but note that doing
.RE
so may leave artifacts (temporary files) behind, and in rare cases, lead to
.RE
image corruption.

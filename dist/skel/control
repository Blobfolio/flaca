Description: Brute-force Lossless Compression for JPEG and PNG
 Flaca is a CLI frontend written in Rust to aid the complex task of
 squeezing every last drop of space out of JPEG and PNG images â€”
 without sacrificing quality.
 .
 Flaca uses MozJPEG and Jpegoptim for JPEG re-compression and pngout,
 Oxipng, and Zopflipng for PNG compression.
 .
 The binaries are not bundled with this package and must be installed
 separately.
